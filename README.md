# iOS Programming Cookbook
This is the code repository for [iOS Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/ios-programming-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786460981), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Do you want to understand all the facets of iOS programming and build complex iOS apps? Then you have come to the right place. This problem-solution guide will help you to eliminate expensive learning curves and focus on specific issues to make you proficient at tasks and the speed-up time involved.
### Instructions and Navigations
All of the codes are organized as per the chapters, each folder has the codes related to that chapter or appendix.                   
For example:  iOS-Programming-Cookbook/Chapter 1/Closures.playground/Contents.swift



The code will look like the following:
```
{ (parameters) ->returnType in 
   // block of code goes here 
}
```

### Visualization to use as inspiration

### To add somewhere

- Testing with D3.js


## To add somewhere

### Build
- Show how to build custom D3.js libraries by concatting stuff together.
- Write something about de packaging of D3.js
- Say we'll just reference the javascript stuff, and don't use commonjs / requirejs or something.
- Show that you can also reference them to CDNJS or npmCDN or from the d3.js site.
- Might add workflow to get in production by packaging vendor and common files

In our examples, we'll run them locally, which provides the best experience when developing.
